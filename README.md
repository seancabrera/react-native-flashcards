# React Native Flashcards
---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a mobile flash card app using React Native.

I used the React Native Expo client and the React Native Elements library to build this app.

This app has been succesfully tested on the Android platform.

## Local Build Instructions

The following instructions can be used to run a production build of the app locally.

First clone or download the project:

`git clone https://github.com/seancabrera/react-native-flashcards`

Then, in a terminal, navigate to the downloaded repository and run the following npm commands:

`npm install`

`expo start -c`

This will bring up the Expo client in the browser. From there, you can either run the app in a simulator or on an Android device using the QR Code.
